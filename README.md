# My 2017 Resolutions

Here's what I resolve to do in 2017. We all say we're going to try to do
something but we're never sure just how important something can really be until
the time comes, otherwise we just forget about it.  Things change throughout the
year, too.  Rather than just say what I would like to do, I'm going to do the
nerd thing and track it!  I'm going to use GitHub issues and pull requests to
mark items on the list as done or "NTBF" (Not To Be Fixed). In no particular
order, here's what I am going to try to do.

- [ ] Don't die.

      This sounds rather heavy but I've had some rather scary health issues to
      get sorted which are ongoing. This is obviously Priority 1, seeing as it
      blocks everything below. ;-)

- [ ] Implement a custom console system and RISC-like CPU on FPGA.

- [ ] Finish my OPL-like hard FM synthesizer chip and make an album with it.

      I'll be porting this over to SystemVerilog and trying out a Xilinx Zynq
      APoC to see how well the ARM-FPGA interface works.

- [ ] Obtain some mastery in SystemVerilog.

      I only know Verilog 2001 and am always running into some frustrating
      limitations that are relieved in SystemVerilog.

- [ ] Make progress on the Synth Spaceship.

      I'm going to fill my studio with modulars until there are concerns for the
      load-bearing capacity of the floor. Please don't tell my landlord.

- [ ] Release four electronic music albums.

      At least one must be >= 60 minutes.

- [ ] Design and build a modular analog synthesizer from scratch.

      I've always wanted to do this and, now that I've got an CV-exponential
      control circuit, I can start building the classic oscillators.

- [ ] Immutable ASTs, structured editing, formatting, a foundation for macros.

      This one isn't entirely up to me, so we'll see.

- [X] Mystery Item #1.

- [ ] Mystery Item #2.

- [ ] Mystery Item #3.

- [ ] Mystery Item #4.

- [ ] Play a live chiptune set.

     I've finally got close to enough material for this; just need to find the
     right time and place.

- [ ] Do some pickling.

      One word: pickles! Pickle, pickle, pickle. Say it until it loses its
      meaning: pickle!

- [X] Pierce something.

      Why the hell not?

- [ ] Get certified on an injection molder.

      I've struggled to find the right project for this because mold volumes are
      limited but what would be perfect is a keyboard controller! Piano keys are
      repeated, small parts, so it should be a straightforward set of molds to
      create and be applicable to packaging up the FM synth.

- [ ] Grow something difficult indoors.

      Like mushrooms, or something cute for the kitchen. Spent enough money on a
      Botany degree, might as well use it for something ...

- [ ] Be more methodical about practicing:

      - Drawing

        I used to draw quite a bit in design school and now it seems like ages
        ago (because it was). Specifically, figure and anatomical drawings from
        memory is what I want to focus on this year.

      - Piano
        
        I really want to specifically hone my improvisation skills. Continuing
        composing and recording is really good but not very principled, so I
        want to take a little bit of time to do some smaller, more focused
        exercises, and practice someone else's music.

- [ ] Volunteer some time for a cause I care about.

      I haven't decided what this will be yet but I think it's important for a
      balanced and useful life.

- [ ] Experience a real American desert landscape.

- [ ] Read 3 fiction books.

      This is rather modest compared to some but, hey, this list is getting
      long! :-P
